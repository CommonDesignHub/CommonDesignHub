Common Physical Design Initiative and Open Engineering Empowerment

The purpose of this initiative is to free up the means of production from monopolistic proprietary design and contractual productions to a collaborative open design and free market part supplier economy.  This assumes the establishment of an open design commons in which people are free to collaborate on any sort of physical design and its parts and then are free to get in touch with open market suppliers ordering parts for their own assembly or for an independent assembly business.  This bypasses monopolization of common design thus encouraging a maker economy and ideally, over time, iterating on common goods and achieving stabilization in product quality and part replaceability designed not for the economic success of a vertically structured middle design company, but for optimized quality of a home good for the consumer market.  

This means that any given person may be able to download the open specs for a versional design for a common product, such as a washing machine, get in touch directly with part manufacturers in regards to, for example,  casing, rotating apparatus, power components and order from the part supplier directly.  Or even, such a system would enable businesses that function as more industrially horizontally as the current day.

The means of producing such a system would include 1. a means for open source design collaboration and 2. a means for shopping through a catalog of part suppliers related to a project’s design.

The details of said plans can take shape creating two web entities:

1.Design from scratch or fork an open source application for open source physical design respository management (like a github for physical design)  Said platform should have...
a.  …. master branches that iterate and improve over time.  Other designers should be able to fork said designs, push changes and submit pull requests, key features of collaboration.
b. … an enhanced ability to view 3d models on the web, including potentially 3d diffs
c. … API accessibility to view the key features of said product branch.  This should include part hierarchy, official product and part categorizations, along with previews and potentially design specs.

2.  A browsing catalog of open design projects that connect consumers/ assemblers that are “shopping” for a product, with the suppliers of the project’s parts.  This should be done by means of consuming the API mentioned previously from the repository manager (The equivalent of an ecommerce app)

This is already partially observed in the 3d printing world and in beginning steps on other web platforms (grabCAD). There are open source designs that are available and meant for 3d printers.  Even without a 3d printer, it is relatively straight forward getting in touch a 3d printing business for printing parts and then assembling a project on ones own.

This design is particularly useful as such a platform grows, it may not be of the most cost effective means at first, but as suppliers and assemblers grow saturated around a common design and such a design becomes iterated upon, still upholding the washing machine analogy, one will have more power in upkeep and in the end, face reduced cost and improved quality.  It will be easy to buy parts in the event of failure, the product will be durable and engineered to last and the consumers will be given the ability to directly influence and assist in the design in the products they use every day for the common good.
